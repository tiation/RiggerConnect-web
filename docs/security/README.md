üîí **ChaseWhiteRabbit NGO Ethical Security Standards**

## üéØ Security Mission

As part of ChaseWhiteRabbit NGO's commitment to ethical technology, we prioritize the security and privacy of our users - hardworking riggers who trust us with their professional data.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Framework

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for all user accounts
- **OAuth 2.0 + PKCE**: Secure authentication flow
- **JWT Token Management**: Short-lived access tokens with refresh rotation
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions based on user roles

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **PII Handling**: Strict data minimization and anonymization
- **GDPR Compliance**: Full user data control and portability

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Regular image scanning and updates
- **Network Security**: Zero-trust network architecture
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security event monitoring
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with geographic redundancy

## üîç Security Practices

### Development Security
```bash
# Security linting
npm run security:lint

# Dependency vulnerability scanning
npm audit
snyk test

# SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
npm run security:static-analysis

# Container security scanning
docker scout cves riggerconnect-web:latest
```

### Code Security Standards
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated
